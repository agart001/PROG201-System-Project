## Description
The project demonstrates how simple actors and actor interacts can create complex emergent systems. The project explores the relationship between the Yucca plant and the Yucca moth, each one is dependent on the other, while also accounting for outside pressures like Weather and other animals. I choose to spend a lot of time on the project's vizuals, creating a real-time grid simulation of each actor in the environment.
